(** %\part{Programming with Dependent Types}

\chapter{Subset Types and Variations}% *)

(** So far, we have seen many examples of what we might call "classical program verification."  We write programs, write their specifications, and then prove that the programs satisfy their specifications.  The programs that we have written in Coq have been normal functional programs that we could just as well have written in Haskell or ML.  In this chapter, we start investigating uses of%\index{dependent types}% _dependent types_ to integrate programming, specification, and proving into a single phase.  The techniques we will learn make it possible to reduce the cost of program verification dramatically. *)


(** * Introducing Subset Types *)

(** Let us consider several ways of implementing the natural number predecessor function.  We start by displaying the definition from the standard library: *)

Print pred.
(** %\vspace{-.15in}% [[
pred = fun n : nat => match n with
                      | 0 => 0
                      | S u => u
                      end
     : nat -> nat
 
]]

We can use a new command, %\index{Vernacular commands!Extraction}\index{program extraction}\index{extraction|see{program extraction}}%[Extraction], to produce an %\index{OCaml}%OCaml version of this function. *)

Extraction pred.

(**
<<
(** val pred : nat -> nat **)

let pred = function
  | O -> O
  | S u -> u
>>
*)

(** Returning 0 as the predecessor of 0 can come across as somewhat of a hack.  In some situations, we might like to be sure that we never try to take the predecessor of 0.  We can enforce this by giving [pred] a stronger, dependent type. *)

Lemma zgtz : 0 > 0 -> False.
  crush.
Qed.

Definition pred_strong1 (n : nat) : n > 0 -> nat :=
  match n with
    | O => fun pf : 0 > 0 => match zgtz pf with end
    | S n' => fun _ => n'
  end.

(** We expand the type of [pred] to include a _proof_ that its argument [n] is greater than 0.  When [n] is 0, we use the proof to derive a contradiction, which we can use to build a value of any type via a vacuous pattern match.  When [n] is a successor, we have no need for the proof and just return the answer.  The proof argument can be said to have a _dependent_ type, because its type depends on the _value_ of the argument [n].

   Coq's [Eval] command can execute particular invocations of [pred_strong1] just as easily as it can execute more traditional functional programs.  Note that Coq has decided that argument [n] of [pred_strong1] can be made _implicit_, since it can be deduced from the type of the second argument, so we need not write [n] in function calls. *)

     : nat
 ]]

One aspect in particular of the definition of [pred_strong1] may be surprising.  We took advantage of [Definition]'s syntactic sugar for defining function arguments in the case of [n], but we bound the proofs later with explicit [fun] expressions.  Let us see what happens if we write this function in the way that at first seems most natural.

%\vspace{-.15in}%[[
Definition pred_strong1' (n : nat) (pf : n > 0) : nat :=
  match n with
    | O => match zgtz pf with end
    | S n' => n'
  end.
]]

<<
Error: In environment
n : nat
pf : n > 0
The term "pf" has type "n > 0" while it is expected to have type 
"0 > 0"
>>

The term [zgtz pf] fails to type-check.  Somehow the type checker has failed to take into account information that follows from which [match] branch that term appears in.  The problem is that, by default, [match] does not let us use such implied information.  To get refined typing, we must always rely on [match] annotations, either written explicitly or inferred.

In this case, we must use a [return] annotation to declare the relationship between the _value_ of the [match] discriminee and the _type_ of the result.  There is no annotation that lets us declare a relationship between the discriminee and the type of a variable that is already in scope; hence, we delay the binding of [pf], so that we can use the [return] annotation to express the needed relationship.

We are lucky that Coq's heuristics infer the [return] clause (specifically, [return n > 0 -> nat]) for us in the definition of [pred_strong1], leading to the following elaborated code: *)

Definition pred_strong1' (n : nat) : n > 0 -> nat :=
  match n return n > 0 -> nat with
    | O => fun pf : 0 > 0 => match zgtz pf with end
    | S n' => fun _ => n'
  end.

(** By making explicit the functional relationship between value [n] and the result type of the [match], we guide Coq toward proper type checking.  The clause for this example follows by simple copying of the original annotation on the definition.  In general, however, the [match] annotation inference problem is undecidable.  The known undecidable problem of%\index{higher-order unification}% _higher-order unification_ %\cite{HOU}% reduces to the [match] type inference problem.  Over time, Coq is enhanced with more and more heuristics to get around this problem, but there must always exist [match]es whose types Coq cannot infer without annotations.

Let us now take a look at the OCaml code Coq generates for [pred_strong1]. *)

(** The proof argument has disappeared!  We get exactly the OCaml code we would have written manually.  This is our first demonstration of the main technically interesting feature of Coq program extraction: proofs are erased systematically.

We can reimplement our dependently typed [pred] based on%\index{subset types}% _subset types_, defined in the standard library with the type family %\index{Gallina terms!sig}%[sig]. *)

The family [sig] is a Curry-Howard twin of [ex], except that [sig] is in [Type], while [ex] is in [Prop].  That means that [sig] values can survive extraction, while [ex] proofs will always be erased.  The actual details of extraction of [sig]s are more subtle, as we will see shortly.

We rewrite [pred_strong1], using some syntactic sugar for subset types. *)

  end.

(** To build a value of a subset type, we use the [exist] constructor, and the details of how to do that follow from the output of our earlier [Print sig] command, where we elided the extra information that parameter [A] is implicit.  We need an extra [_] here and not in the definition of [pred_strong2] because _parameters_ of inductive types (like the predicate [P] for [sig]) are not mentioned in pattern matching, but _are_ mentioned in construction of terms (if they are not marked as implicit arguments). *)

We arrive at the same OCaml code as was extracted from [pred_strong1], which may seem surprising at first.  The reason is that a value of [sig] is a pair of two pieces, a value and a proof about it.  Extraction erases the proof, which reduces the constructor [exist] of [sig] to taking just a single argument.  An optimization eliminates uses of datatypes with single constructors taking single arguments, and we arrive back where we started.

We can continue on in the process of refining [pred]'s type.  Let us change its result type to capture that the output is really the predecessor of the input. *)

  match s return {m : nat | proj1_sig s = S m} with

(** A value in a subset type can be thought of as a%\index{dependent pair}% _dependent pair_ (or%\index{sigma type}% _sigma type_) of a base value and a proof about it.  The function %\index{Gallina terms!proj1\_sig}%[proj1_sig] extracts the first component of the pair.  It turns out that we need to include an explicit [return] clause here, since Coq's heuristics are not smart enough to propagate the result type that we wrote earlier.

By now, the reader is probably ready to believe that the new [pred_strong] leads to the same OCaml code as we have seen several times so far, and Coq does not disappoint. *)

We have managed to reach a type that is, in a formal sense, the most expressive possible for [pred].  Any other implementation of the same type must have the same input-output behavior.  However, there is still room for improvement in making this kind of code easier to write.  Here is a version that takes advantage of tactic-based theorem proving.  We switch back to passing a separate proof argument instead of using a subset type for the function's input, because this leads to cleaner code.  (Recall that [False_rec] is the [Set]-level induction principle for [False], which can be used to produce a value in any [Set] given a proof of [False].) *)

Definition pred_strong4 : forall n : nat, n > 0 -> {m : nat | n = S m}.

(* begin thide *)
  (** We build [pred_strong4] using tactic-based proving, beginning with a [Definition] command that ends in a period before a definition is given.  Such a command enters the interactive proving mode, with the type given for the new identifier as our proof goal.  It may seem strange to change perspective so implicitly between programming and proving, but recall that programs and proofs are two sides of the same coin in Coq, thanks to the Curry-Howard correspondence.

     We do most of the work with the %\index{tactics!refine}%[refine] tactic, to which we pass a partial "proof" of the type we are trying to prove.  There may be some pieces left to fill in, indicated by underscores.  Any underscore that Coq cannot reconstruct with type inference is added as a proof subgoal.  In this case, we have two subgoals:

[[
2 subgoals
  
  n : nat
  _ : 0 > 0
  ============================
   False

subgoal 2 is

 S n' = S n'
 ]]

We can see that the first subgoal comes from the second underscore passed to [False_rec], and the second subgoal comes from the second underscore passed to [exist].  In the first case, we see that, though we bound the proof variable with an underscore, it is still available in our proof context.  It is hard to refer to underscore-named variables in manual proofs, but automation makes short work of them.  Both subgoals are easy to discharge that way, so let us back up and ask to prove all subgoals automatically. *)

(** We end the "proof" with %\index{Vernacular commands!Defined}%[Defined] instead of [Qed], so that the definition we constructed remains visible.  This contrasts to the case of ending a proof with [Qed], where the details of the proof are hidden afterward.  (More formally, [Defined] marks an identifier as%\index{transparent}% _transparent_, allowing it to be unfolded; while [Qed] marks an identifier as%\index{opaque}% _opaque_, preventing unfolding.)  Let us see what our proof script constructed. *)

(** Printing the resulting definition of [pred_strong6] yields a term very similar to what we built with [refine].  [Program] can save time in writing programs that use subset types.  Nonetheless, [refine] is often just as effective, and [refine] gives more control over the form the final term takes, which can be useful when you want to prove additional theorems about your definition.  [Program] will sometimes insert type casts that can complicate theorem proving. *)

Here, the constructors of [sumbool] have types written in terms of a registered notation for [sumbool], such that the result type of each constructor desugars to [sumbool A B].  We can define some notations of our own to make working with [sumbool] more convenient. *)

Notation "'Yes'" := (left _ _).
Notation "'No'" := (right _ _).
Notation "'Reduce' x" := (if x then Yes else No) (at level 50).

(** The %\coqdocnotation{%#<tt>#Reduce#</tt>#%}% notation is notable because it demonstrates how [if] is overloaded in Coq.  The [if] form actually works when the test expression has any two-constructor inductive type.  Moreover, in the [then] and [else] branches, the appropriate constructor arguments are bound.  This is important when working with [sumbool]s, when we want to have the proof stored in the test expression available when proving the proof obligations generated in the appropriate branch.

Now we can write [eq_nat_dec], which compares two natural numbers, returning either a proof of their equality or a proof of their inequality. *)

(** * Monadic Notations *)

(** We can treat [maybe] like a monad%~\cite{Monads}\index{monad}\index{failure monad}%, in the same way that the Haskell <<Maybe>> type is interpreted as a failure monad.  Our [maybe] has the wrong type to be a literal monad, but a "bind"-like notation will still be helpful.  %Note that the notation definition uses an ASCII \texttt{<-}, while later code uses (in this rendering) a nicer left arrow $\leftarrow$.% *)

Notation "x <- e1 ; e2" := (match e1 with
                             | Unknown => ??
                             | Found x _ => e2
                           end)
(right associativity, at level 60).

(** The meaning of [x <- e1; e2] is: First run [e1].  If it fails to find an answer, then announce failure for our derived computation, too.  If [e1] _does_ find an answer, pass that answer on to [e2] to find the final result.  The variable [x] can be considered bound in [e2].

   This notation is very helpful for composing richly typed procedures.  For instance, here is a very simple implementation of a function to take the predecessors of two naturals at once. *)

(* EX: Write a function that tries to compute predecessors of two [nat]s at once. *)

(* begin thide *)
Definition doublePred : forall n1 n2 : nat, {{p | n1 = S (fst p) /\ n2 = S (snd p)}}.
  refine (fun n1 n2 =>
    m1 <- pred_strong7 n1;
    m2 <- pred_strong7 n2;
    [|(m1, m2)|]); tauto.
Defined.
(* end thide *)

(** We can build a [sumor] version of the "bind" notation and use it to write a similarly straightforward version of this function.  %Again, the notation definition exposes the ASCII syntax with an operator \texttt{<-{}-}, while the later code uses a nicer long left arrow $\longleftarrow$.% *)

(** %\def\indash{-}\catcode`-=13\def-{\indash\kern0pt }% *)

Notation "x <-- e1 ; e2" := (match e1 with
                               | inright _ => !!
                               | inleft (exist x _) => e2
                             end)
(right associativity, at level 60).

(** %\catcode`-=12% *)(* *)
(** printing * $\times$ *)

(* EX: Write a more expressively typed version of the last exercise. *)

(* begin thide *)

    m1 <-- pred_strong8 n1;
    m2 <-- pred_strong8 n2;

(** This example demonstrates how judicious selection of notations can hide complexities in the rich types of programs. *)


(** * A Type-Checking Example *)

(** We can apply these specification types to build a certified type checker for a simple expression language. *)

Inductive exp : Set :=
| Nat : nat -> exp
| Plus : exp -> exp -> exp
| Bool : bool -> exp
| And : exp -> exp -> exp.

(** We define a simple language of types and its typing rules, in the style introduced in Chapter 4. *)

Inductive type : Set := TNat | TBool.

Inductive hasType : exp -> type -> Prop :=
| HtNat : forall n,
  hasType (Nat n) TNat
| HtPlus : forall e1 e2,
  hasType e1 TNat
  -> hasType e2 TNat
  -> hasType (Plus e1 e2) TNat
| HtBool : forall b,
  hasType (Bool b) TBool
| HtAnd : forall e1 e2,
  hasType e1 TBool
  -> hasType e2 TBool
  -> hasType (And e1 e2) TBool.

(** It will be helpful to have a function for comparing two types.  We build one using [decide equality]. *)

(* begin thide *)
Definition eq_type_dec : forall t1 t2 : type, {t1 = t2} + {t1 <> t2}.
  decide equality.
Defined.

(** Another notation complements the monadic notation for [maybe] that we defined earlier.  Sometimes we want to include "assertions" in our procedures.  That is, we want to run a decision procedure and fail if it fails; otherwise, we want to continue, with the proof that it produced made available to us.  This infix notation captures that idea, for a procedure that returns an arbitrary two-constructor type. *)

Notation "e1 ;; e2" := (if e1 then e2 else ??)
  (right associativity, at level 60).

(** With that notation defined, we can implement a [typeCheck] function, whose code is only more complex than what we would write in ML because it needs to include some extra type annotations.  Every [[|e|]] expression adds a [hasType] proof obligation, and [crush] makes short work of them when we add [hasType]'s constructors as hints. *)
(* end thide *)
