(** %\chapter{Dependent Data Structures}% *)

(** Our red-black tree example from the last chapter illustrated how dependent types enable static enforcement of data structure invariants.  To find interesting uses of dependent data structures, however, we need not look to the favorite examples of data structures and algorithms textbooks.  More basic examples like length-indexed and heterogeneous lists come up again and again as the building blocks of dependent programs.  There is a surprisingly large design space for this class of data structure, and we will spend this chapter exploring it. *)


(** * More Length-Indexed Lists *)

(** We begin with a deeper look at the length-indexed lists that began the last chapter.%\index{Gallina terms!ilist}% *)

Section ilist.
  Variable A : Set.

  Inductive ilist : nat -> Set :=
  | Nil : ilist O
  | Cons : forall n, A -> ilist n -> ilist (S n).

  (** We might like to have a certified function for selecting an element of an [ilist] by position.  We could do this using subset types and explicit manipulation of proofs, but dependent types let us do it more directly.  It is helpful to define a type family %\index{Gallina terms!fin}%[fin], where [fin n] is isomorphic to [{m : nat | m < n}].  The type family name stands for "finite." *)

  (* EX: Define a function [get] for extracting an [ilist] element by position. *)

(* begin thide *)
  Inductive fin : nat -> Set :=
  | First : forall n, fin (S n)
  | Next : forall n, fin n -> fin (S n).

  (** An instance of [fin] is essentially a more richly typed copy of a prefix of the natural numbers.  Every element is a [First] iterated through applying [Next] a number of times that indicates which number is being selected.  For instance, the three values of type [fin 3] are [First 2], [Next (First 1)], and [Next (Next (First 0))].

     Now it is easy to pick a [Prop]-free type for a selection function.  As usual, our first implementation attempt will not convince the type checker, and we will attack the deficiencies one at a time.
     [[
  Fixpoint get n (ls : ilist n) : fin n -> A :=
    match ls with
      | Nil => fun idx => ?
      | Cons _ x ls' => fun idx =>
        match idx with
          | First _ => x
          | Next _ idx' => get ls' idx'
        end
    end.
    ]]
    %\vspace{-.15in}%We apply the usual wisdom of delaying arguments in [Fixpoint]s so that they may be included in [return] clauses.  This still leaves us with a quandary in each of the [match] cases.  First, we need to figure out how to take advantage of the contradiction in the [Nil] case.  Every [fin] has a type of the form [S n], which cannot unify with the [O] value that we learn for [n] in the [Nil] case.  The solution we adopt is another case of [match]-within-[return], with the [return] clause chosen carefully so that it returns the proper type [A] in case the [fin] index is [O], which we know is true here; and so that it returns an easy-to-inhabit type [unit] in the remaining, impossible cases, which nonetheless appear explicitly in the body of the [match].
    [[
  Fixpoint get n (ls : ilist n) : fin n -> A :=
    match ls with
      | Nil => fun idx =>
        match idx in fin n' return (match n' with
                                        | O => A
                                        | S _ => unit
                                      end) with
          | First _ => tt
          | Next _ _ => tt
        end
      | Cons _ x ls' => fun idx =>
        match idx with
          | First _ => x
          | Next _ idx' => get ls' idx'
        end
    end.
    ]]
    %\vspace{-.15in}%Now the first [match] case type-checks, and we see that the problem with the [Cons] case is that the pattern-bound variable [idx'] does not have an apparent type compatible with [ls'].  In fact, the error message Coq gives for this exact code can be confusing, thanks to an overenthusiastic type inference heuristic.  We are told that the [Nil] case body has type [match X with | O => A | S _ => unit end] for a unification variable [X], while it is expected to have type [A].  We can see that setting [X] to [O] resolves the conflict, but Coq is not yet smart enough to do this unification automatically.  Repeating the function's type in a [return] annotation, used with an [in] annotation, leads us to a more informative error message, saying that [idx'] has type [fin n1] while it is expected to have type [fin n0], where [n0] is bound by the [Cons] pattern and [n1] by the [Next] pattern.  As the code is written above, nothing forces these two natural numbers to be equal, though we know intuitively that they must be.

    We need to use [match] annotations to make the relationship explicit.  Unfortunately, the usual trick of postponing argument binding will not help us here.  We need to match on both [ls] and [idx]; one or the other must be matched first.  To get around this, we apply the convoy pattern that we met last chapter.  This application is a little more clever than those we saw before; we use the natural number predecessor function [pred] to express the relationship between the types of these variables.

    %\vspace{-.15in}%There is just one problem left with this implementation.  Though we know that the local [ls'] in the [Next] case is equal to the original [ls'], the type-checker is not satisfied that the recursive call to [get] does not introduce non-termination.

(** * Heterogeneous Lists *)

(** Programmers who move to statically typed functional languages from scripting languages often complain about the requirement that every element of a list have the same type.  With fancy type systems, we can partially lift this requirement.  We can index a list type with a "type-level" list that explains what type each element of the list should have.  This has been done in a variety of ways in Haskell using type classes, and we can do it much more cleanly and directly in Coq. *)

  (** Because the element [elm] that we are "searching for" in a list does not change across the constructors of [member], we simplify our definitions by making [elm] a local variable.  In the definition of [member], we say that [elm] is found in any list that begins with [elm], and, if removing the first element of a list leaves [elm] present, then [elm] is present in the original list, too.  The form looks much like a predicate for list membership, but we purposely define [member] in [Type] so that we may decompose its values to guide computations.

     We can use [member] to adapt our definition of [get] to [hlist]s.  The same basic [match] tricks apply.  In the [HCons] case, we form a two-element convoy, passing both the data element [x] and the recursor for the sublist [mls'] to the result of the inner [match].  We did not need to do that in [get]'s definition because the types of list elements were not dependent there. *)

(** ** A Lambda Calculus Interpreter *)

(** Heterogeneous lists are very useful in implementing %\index{interpreters}%interpreters for functional programming languages.  Using the types and operations we have already defined, it is trivial to write an interpreter for simply typed lambda calculus%\index{lambda calculus}%.  Our interpreter can alternatively be thought of as a denotational semantics (but worry not if you are not familiar with such terminology from semantics).

   We start with an algebraic datatype for types. *)

Inductive type : Set :=
| Unit : type
| Arrow : type -> type -> type.

(** Now we can define a type family for expressions.  An [exp ts t] will stand for an expression that has type [t] and whose free variables have types in the list [ts].  We effectively use the de Bruijn index variable representation%~\cite{DeBruijn}%.  Variables are represented as [member] values; that is, a variable is more or less a constructive proof that a particular type is found in the type environment. *)

Inductive exp : list type -> type -> Set :=
| Const : forall ts, exp ts Unit
(* begin thide *)
| Var : forall ts t, member t ts -> exp ts t
| App : forall ts dom ran, exp ts (Arrow dom ran) -> exp ts dom -> exp ts ran
| Abs : forall ts dom ran, exp (dom :: ts) ran -> exp ts (Arrow dom ran).
(* end thide *)

Arguments Const [ts].

(** We write a simple recursive function to translate [type]s into [Set]s. *)

Fixpoint typeDenote (t : type) : Set :=
  match t with
    | Unit => unit
    | Arrow t1 t2 => typeDenote t1 -> typeDenote t2
  end.

(** Now it is straightforward to write an expression interpreter.  The type of the function, [expDenote], tells us that we translate expressions into functions from properly typed environments to final values.  An environment for a free variable list [ts] is simply an [hlist typeDenote ts].  That is, for each free variable, the heterogeneous list that is the environment must have a value of the variable's associated type.  We use [hget] to implement the [Var] case, and we use [HCons] to extend the environment in the [Abs] case. *)

(* EX: Define an interpreter for [exp]s. *)

(* begin thide *)
Fixpoint expDenote ts t (e : exp ts t) : hlist typeDenote ts -> typeDenote t :=

    | Const _ => fun _ => tt

    | App _ _ _ e1 e2 => fun s => (expDenote e1 s) (expDenote e2 s)
    | Abs _ _ _ e' => fun s => fun x => expDenote e' (HCons x s)

(* end thide *)

(** We are starting to develop the tools behind dependent typing's amazing advantage over alternative approaches in several important areas.  Here, we have implemented complete syntax, typing rules, and evaluation semantics for simply typed lambda calculus without even needing to define a syntactic substitution operation.  We did it all without a single line of proof, and our implementation is manifestly executable.  Other, more common approaches to language formalization often state and prove explicit theorems about type safety of languages.  In the above example, we got type safety, termination, and other meta-theorems for free, by reduction to CIC, which we know has those properties. *)


(** * Recursive Type Definitions *)

(** %\index{recursive type definition}%There is another style of datatype definition that leads to much simpler definitions of the [get] and [hget] definitions above.  Because Coq supports "type-level computation," we can redo our inductive definitions as _recursive_ definitions.  Here we will preface type names with the letter [f] to indicate that they are based on explicit recursive _function_ definitions. *)

We express that idea with a sum type whose left branch is the appropriate equality proposition.  Since we define [fmember] to live in [Type], we can insert [Prop] types as needed, because [Prop] is a subtype of [Type].

  The special-case rule for nested datatypes only works with nested uses of other inductive types, which could be replaced with uses of new mutually inductive types.  We defined [filist] recursively, so it may not be used in nested inductive definitions.

  Our final solution uses yet another of the inductive definition techniques introduced in Chapter 3, %\index{reflexive inductive type}%reflexive types.  Instead of merely using [fin] to get elements out of [ilist], we can _define_ [ilist] in terms of [fin].  For the reasons outlined above, it turns out to be easier to work with [ffin] in place of [fin]. *)

(** Even if Coq would generate complete induction principles automatically for nested inductive definitions like the one we started with, there would still be advantages to using this style of reflexive encoding.  We see one of those advantages in the definition of [inc], where we did not need to use any kind of auxiliary function.  In general, reflexive encodings often admit direct implementations of operations that would require recursion if performed with more traditional inductive data structures. *)

(** ** Another Interpreter Example *)

(** We develop another example of variable-arity constructors, in the form of optimization of a small expression language with a construct like Scheme's <<cond>>.  Each of our conditional expressions takes a list of pairs of boolean tests and bodies.  The value of the conditional comes from the body of the first test in the list to evaluate to [true].  To simplify the %\index{interpreters}%interpreter we will write, we force each conditional to include a final, default case. *)

(** A [Cond] is parameterized by a natural [n], which tells us how many cases this conditional has.  The test expressions are represented with a function of type [ffin n -> exp' Bool], and the bodies are represented with a function of type [ffin n -> exp' t], where [t] is the overall type.  The final [exp' t] argument is the default case.  For example, here is an expression that successively checks whether [2 + 2 = 5] (returning 0 if so) or if [1 + 1 = 2] (returning 1 if so), returning 2 otherwise. *)

(** * Choosing Between Representations *)

(** It is not always clear which of these representation techniques to apply in a particular situation, but I will try to summarize the pros and cons of each.

   Inductive types are often the most pleasant to work with, after someone has spent the time implementing some basic library functions for them, using fancy [match] annotations.  Many aspects of Coq's logic and tactic support are specialized to deal with inductive types, and you may miss out if you use alternate encodings.

   Recursive types usually involve much less initial effort, but they can be less convenient to use with proof automation.  For instance, the [simpl] tactic (which is among the ingredients in [crush]) will sometimes be overzealous in simplifying uses of functions over recursive types.  Consider a call [get l f], where variable [l] has type [filist A (S n)].  The type of [l] would be simplified to an explicit pair type.  In a proof involving many recursive types, this kind of unhelpful "simplification" can lead to rapid bloat in the sizes of subgoals.  Even worse, it can prevent syntactic pattern-matching, like in cases where [filist] is expected but a pair type is found in the "simplified" version.  The same problem applies to applications of recursive functions to values in recursive types: the recursive function call may "simplify" when the top-level structure of the type index but not the recursive value is known, because such functions are generally defined by recursion on the index, not the value.

   Another disadvantage of recursive types is that they only apply to type families whose indices determine their "skeletons."  This is not true for all data structures; a good counterexample comes from the richly typed programming language syntax types we have used several times so far.  The fact that a piece of syntax has type [Nat] tells us nothing about the tree structure of that syntax.

   Finally, Coq type inference can be more helpful in constructing values in inductive types.  Application of a particular constructor of that type tells Coq what to expect from the arguments, while, for instance, forming a generic pair does not make clear an intention to interpret the value as belonging to a particular recursive type.  This downside can be mitigated to an extent by writing "constructor" functions for a recursive type, mirroring the definition of the corresponding inductive type.

   Reflexive encodings of data types are seen relatively rarely.  As our examples demonstrated, manipulating index values manually can lead to hard-to-read code.  A normal inductive type is generally easier to work with, once someone has gone through the trouble of implementing an induction principle manually with the techniques we studied in Chapter 3.  For small developments, avoiding that kind of coding can justify the use of reflexive data structures.  There are also some useful instances of %\index{co-inductive types}%co-inductive definitions with nested data structures (e.g., lists of values in the co-inductive type) that can only be deconstructed effectively with reflexive encoding of the nested structures. *)
